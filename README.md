A. HTML PROJECTS – Beginners

These projects are beginner-level and will help you understand basic HTML structure, such as how to use:
    • Headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.).
    • Lists (<ul>, <ol>, <li>).
    • Links (<a>).
    • Images (<img>).


1. Peter’s Portfolio

A simple personal portfolio page is a great starting point. You can showcase your hobbies, skills, or projects, but it'll be entirely static—no styling or interactivity.
Lessons from the project-
    • Learn how to structure content with headings, paragraphs, and lists.
    • Link to external resources (like social profiles or GitHub).
Example Structure:
    • Header: Your name and a short bio.
    • About Me Section: A short introduction about yourself.
    • Skills Section: A list of your skills or interests.
    • Projects Section: Links to projects (if any).
    • Footer: Contact info or social links.

    

2. Photo Gallery

A basic photo gallery can showcase your favorite images or any thematic collection (e.g., nature photos, artworks, etc.). This is entirely static, just presenting images in an organized layout.
Example Structure:
    • Header: Title for the gallery.
    • Gallery Section: Display a series of images.
    • Footer: Copyright or additional links.
Lessons from the project-
    • Use images in HTML (<img> tag).
    • Display images in a simple layout.
    • Provide an "alt" description for images, which is useful for accessibility.



3. Recipe Page

A recipe page where you display ingredients, steps, and cooking tips. This project will allow you to present content in an easy-to-read format.
Example Structure:
    • Header: Title of the recipe.
    • Ingredients: A list of ingredients.
    • Instructions: A step-by-step guide to making the dish.
    • Footer: Notes or tips for the recipe.
Lessons from the project-
    • Display items in an ordered list (<ol>) for instructions.
    • Use unordered lists (<ul>) for ingredients.
