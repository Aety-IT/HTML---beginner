HTML PROJECTS – Beginners
These projects are beginner-level and will help you understand basic HTML structure, such as how to use:
1. Peter’s Portfolio
A simple personal portfolio page is a great starting point. You can showcase your hobbies, skills, or projects, but it'll be entirely static—no styling or interactivity.
2. Photo Gallery
A basic photo gallery can showcase your favorite images or any thematic collection (e.g., nature photos, artworks, etc.). This is entirely static, just presenting images in an organized layout.
3. Recipe Page
A recipe page where you display ingredients, steps, and cooking tips. This project will allow you to present content in an easy-to-read format.
